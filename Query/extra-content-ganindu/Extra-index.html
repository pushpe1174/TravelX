                <h2>1. How are shipping rates calculated?</h2>
                <p>The four elements required to calculate shipping costs are shipping point and origin,
                    package weight, package dimensions and expected delivery times.
                    You can calculate the majority of postal shipping rates
                    using these figures.</p>

                    you can return it for a refund. If you've changed your mind
                    and want to return it, you can ask the seller if they'll
                    accept a return.</p>
